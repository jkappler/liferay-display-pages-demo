# Liferay Mapping Demo

A simple demo where we show how to map content of a custom entity in content pages.

To deploy it, uncomment the following line in gradle.properties and point it to the liferay directory:

`liferay.workspace.home.dir=my/liferay/directory`

and then execute from root:

`./gradlew deploy` (Mac or Linux) or `gradlew deploy` (Windows)
